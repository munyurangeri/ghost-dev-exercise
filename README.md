## Development Exercise

> ### [Live site](https://ghost-dev-exercise.onrender.com/) Note it make take a minute to wake up since it is a free/hobby render.com account!!!

As part of our application process, we’d like to see your front-end skills with
a small coding challenge. We’re providing only the desktop design, and we’d like
you to make it responsive for various screen sizes. Feel free to add any
animations or interactions—your creativity won’t go unnoticed!

**The goal is to create a responsive slide block that adapts well to all screen
sizes. Keep in mind that the images and text will eventually be part of a
dynamic site. The fonts used are free Google Fonts, which you can find
[here](https://fonts.google.com/).**

I've added a link to a Figma prototype that you extract images and styles from.
You can view the design online
[here](https://www.figma.com/design/5IvUFQdjZS2DacZbnKbkYW/Development-Exercise?node-id=1-341&node-type=frame&t=J7K7ti9FRhx2pUoZ-0).
You’ll need a Figma account to access the design’s styles and assets. If you
don’t have one yet, you can sign up for a free account
[here](https://www.figma.com).

<!-- TODO:Update this file to reflect the extend of added stuff, apart of the initial requirement of the exercise! -->
