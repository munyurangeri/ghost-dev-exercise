## Development Exercise

As part of our application process, we’d like to see your front-end skills with a small coding challenge. We’re providing only the desktop design, and we’d like you to make it responsive for various screen sizes. Feel free to add any animations or interactions—your creativity won’t go unnoticed!

**The goal is to create a responsive slide block that adapts well to all screen sizes. Keep in mind that the images and text will eventually be part of a dynamic site. The fonts used are free Google Fonts, which you can find [here](https://fonts.google.com/).**

I've added a link to a Figma prototype that you extract images and styles from. You can view the design online [here](https://www.figma.com/design/5IvUFQdjZS2DacZbnKbkYW/Development-Exercise?node-id=1-341&node-type=frame&t=J7K7ti9FRhx2pUoZ-0). You’ll need a Figma account to access the design’s styles and assets. If you don’t have one yet, you can sign up for a free account [here](https://www.figma.com).

Please submit your completed project to shanda@ghost.agency by Tuesday, 10/29. Let me know if you have any questions!
